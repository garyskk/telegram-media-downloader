# Multi-stage build:
#   - "gocore" compiles tgdl-core (core-service/, the Go companion process)
#     on the build host for the target platform — CGO off, so no QEMU and
#     no C toolchain; works the same for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
#   - "seekbar" compiles the hover-sprite sidecar the same way. Node
#     auto-spawns SEEKBAR_BIN when SEEKBAR_SIDECAR_URL is unset, so the
#     image does not download a release tarball on first use.
#   - "deps" installs prod dependencies only (npm ci --omit=dev) so the runtime
#     image stays small.
#   - "runtime" copies node_modules from "deps" + the source, runs as the
#     non-root `node` user, exposes 3000, and ships a healthcheck that hits
#     the dashboard's /api/auth_check endpoint.
#
# Pin a specific patch version. Floating tags drift; this image is reproducible.

# tini    — proper PID 1 (signal handling + zombie reaping). Debian ships
#           the binary at /usr/bin/tini.
# gosu    — drop from root → node after the entrypoint fixes /app/data perms
#           (su-exec equivalent on Debian; same `gosu user "$@"` syntax).
# ffmpeg  — used by src/core/thumbs.js for video first-frame thumbnails
#           and audio cover-art extraction. ~30 MB — tiny next to libvips
#           and node_modules.
# intel-media-va-driver / i965-va-driver — VA-API userland drivers for
#           `-hwaccel vaapi` on Intel (iHD is Gen8+, i965 is Gen4–Gen7).
#           Debian bookworm ships them for amd64 only. An arm64 build
#           has no installation candidate, so they are installed only
#           when TARGETARCH is amd64. Without them, thumbs fall back to
#           CPU decode.
# vainfo  — `vainfo` from libva-utils, every arch. Not used by the app
#           itself; `docker exec <ctr> vainfo` shows whether a driver
#           loaded.
#
# Base is bookworm-slim (glibc) rather than alpine (musl) because
# `onnxruntime-node` (pulled in by @huggingface/transformers for the NSFW
# classifier) ships glibc-only prebuilt .so files; loading them on musl
# crashes the whole process at boot with "ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such
