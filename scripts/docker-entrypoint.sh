# Container entrypoint:
#   1. Ensure /etc/hosts + /etc/resolv.conf are world-readable. Some Docker
#      Engine / host umask combos lay these down as 0640; the non-root
#      `node` user then gets getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN for every hostname
#      (extra_hosts is useless if the file isn't readable).
#   2. Fix ownership + permissions on the bind-mounted /app/data so the
#      `node` user (uid 1000) can always read/write — host-side perms
#      from `docker run -v ./data:/app/data` otherwise win and locked
#      out new installs on Linux hosts.
#   3. Detect every `/dev/dri/render*` and `/dev/dri/card*` device
#      mounted into the container, look up its GID on the host, and add
#      `node` to a matching group so VAAPI / QSV ffmpeg can open the
#      device for hardware-accelerated thumbnails. The host GID varies
#      by distro AND Synology DSM version (DSM 6 ≈ 937, DSM 7 ≈ 100, RHEL
#      uses 39, plain Debian uses 104), so a hard-coded `group_add` in
#      compose isn't portable. Detect at boot instead.
#   4. Drop privileges to `node` via gosu and exec the CMD.
#
# Idempotent: safe to run on every container start. The chown/chmod walk
# is a no-op once perms are already correct (millisecond-cost on most
# volumes; if you have millions of files set FAST_BOOT=1 to skip it).
