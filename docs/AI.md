# AI subsystem

Face detection + face clustering — backed by a small Python sidecar
(`faces-service/`) running insightface buffalo_l (MIT, 512-dim ArcFace
embeddings). The Node app speaks HTTP to the sidecar; everything else
(DBSCAN, cluster ops, label preservation) stays in-process.

The sidecar is **zero-install** on every supported platform — see the
support matrix below.

> **What changed in v2.16.** Semantic image search and auto-tagging were
> removed. Face clustering moved out-of-process. The Node side no longer
> bundles `@vladmandic/face-api` or `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`, both of
> which had broken installs on Windows + Node 22.

Architectures NOT in the prebuilt matrix (32-bit ARM on Pi Zero / Pi 3,
s390x, riscv64, FreeBSD) — the spawn module refuses to download and the
AI maintenance card surfaces an "unsupported platform" message instead
of crashing. Operators on those platforms can build the sidecar from
source (`faces-service/README.md`).

### Python fallback (used when the prebuilt binary is unavailable)

If the prebuilt-binary download fails (the GitHub Release hasn't been
tagged yet, the asset 404s, your corporate proxy blocks GitHub, etc.)
the spawn module falls back to running `python -m tgdl_faces` from the
co-located `faces-service/` source tree. Requirements:

1. The `faces-service/` folder is present next to the Node app (true
   for both dev checkouts and standard installs).
2. A `python3` (or `python` on Windows) interpreter ≥ 3.10 is on PATH.
3. The package deps are installed: `pip install -e faces-service/` from
   the repo root.

When all three gates pass, the sidecar comes up under the host's Python
just like the prebuilt would — the same `/health`, `/info`,
`/detect`, and `/providers` routes are exposed. The dashboard's AI
maintenance page shows the chosen mode in the log feed
(`starting via python fallback` vs `starting prebuilt binary`).

Set `TGDL_FACES_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=false` to opt out of both the binary
download AND the Python fallback in one switch — useful for strict
air-gapped deployments where every auto-acquisition path must be
disabled.

### Inference provider (onnxruntime backend)

The Python sidecar can run on any onnxruntime execution provider
compiled into its wheel. Default is `auto` — sidecar picks the fastest
available (CUDA → CoreML → DirectML → OpenVINO → CPU). Override via
`config.advanced.ai.faces.providers` (or the matching env var) when
the auto-pick guesses wrong (e.g. CUDA driver mismatch).

The AI maintenance page exposes a **Run hardware probe** button that
asks the sidecar to allocate a tiny onnxruntime session against every
candidate provider — only the backends that actually initialise on the
host show up as verified. Same UX as the ffmpeg hardware probe in the
Build thumbnails page.

### onnxruntime variant install matrix

The base `onnxruntime` wheel is **CPU-only** and ships with every
`pip install -e faces-service/`. To unlock GPU acceleration, install
the variant that matches your host. The three variants share the
`onnxruntime` Python module name and cannot coexist — installing a
new one auto-uninstalls the old one.

#### Recommended: auto-detect installer

```bash
pip install -e faces-service/
python -m tgdl_faces.install        # or: tgdl-faces-install
```

The installer probes the host (OS, arch, NVIDIA via `nvidia-smi`,
Intel iGPU via `lspci` / `/dev/dri`) and `pip install`s the matching
extra automatically. Idempotent — safe to re-run after a hardware
change. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--force {cpu,gpu,directml,openvino}`,
`--no-uninstall`.

#### Manual

| Host | GPU vendor | Recommended variant | Install command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows 10+ | NVIDIA (any) | DirectML | `py -m pip install onnxruntime-directml` |
| Windows 10+ | AMD / Intel | DirectML | `py -m pip install onnxruntime-directml` |
| Windows 10+ | NVIDIA + CUDA Toolkit installed | CUDA | `py -m pip install onnxruntime-gpu` |
| Linux | NVIDIA + nvidia-container-toolkit | CUDA | `pip install onnxruntime-gpu` |
| Linux | Intel iGPU / dGPU / NPU | OpenVINO | `pip install onnxruntime-openvino` |
| Linux ARM64 (Pi 4, NAS) | none / no support | CPU | (default) |
| macOS Apple Silicon | M-series GPU | CoreML | (built into base wheel — no extra install) |
| macOS Intel | none | CPU | (default) |

After installing a variant, restart the sidecar (Maintenance → AI →
provider dropdown's change handler triggers `/api/ai/faces/restart`,
or `docker compose restart tgdl-faces`, or just restart the Node app).
Re-run the hardware probe; the new EP should appear verified.

The same extras are exposed via pyproject:

```bash
pip install -e faces-service/[gpu]         # NVIDIA CUDA
pip install -e faces-service/[directml]    # Windows DirectML
pip install -e faces-service/[openvino]    # Intel OpenVINO
```

### Docker / DSM / Synology GPU variants

The compose file ships three mutually-exclusive profiles for the
faces sidecar — pick the one that matches your host hardware:

| Profile | Image tag | Hardware | Compose command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `faces` | `ghcr.io/botnick/tgdl-faces:latest` | CPU only (default; works everywhere) | `docker compose --profile faces up -d` |
| `faces-cuda` | `ghcr.io/botnick/tgdl-faces:cuda-latest` | NVIDIA + nvidia-container-toolkit | `docker compose --profile faces-cuda up -d` |
| `faces-openvino` | `ghcr.io/botnick/tgdl-faces:openvino-latest` | Intel iGPU/dGPU/NPU via /dev/dri | `docker compose --profile faces-openvino up -d` |

All three bind to `container_name: tgdl-faces` and port 8011 inside
the compose network so the main app's `FACES_SERVICE_URL=http://
tgdl-faces:8011` resolves to whichever variant you bring up. Compose
refuses to start more than one at a time.

**CUDA path** — requires the host to have:
1. NVIDIA driver matching the CUDA runtime baked into the image (the
   sidecar uses CUDA 12.x; driver 525+ on Linux, 530+ on Windows WSL2).
2. `nvidia-container-toolkit` installed and configured:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-container-toolkit
   sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```
3. `runtime: nvidia` in the compose service (already set on the
   `tgdl-faces-cuda` block).

Verify with `docker run --rm --gpus all
ghcr.io/botnick/tgdl-faces:cuda-latest nvidia-smi`.

**OpenVINO path** — requires `/dev/dri` exposed to the container.
The compose block mounts it automatically; on Synology DSM 7 grant
the SSH user render-group access first:
```bash
sudo synogroup --add videodriver $(whoami)
sudo synogroup --add video $(whoami)
```

**DSM Docker (Synology)** — DSM 7's Container Manager honours
`profiles:`, so the same compose commands work. For DSM 6 (no profile
support in its older docker-compose), copy the desired `tgdl-faces*`
block into its own compose file and start it independently.

**Raspberry Pi / arm64** — only the CPU profile is supported. ARM
wheels for `onnxruntime-gpu` and `onnxruntime-openvino` are not
published. Pi 4 4GB+ runs buffalo_l at ~2 fps on CPU; the Pi Zero /
Pi 3 are too underpowered (insightface needs ~600 MB RSS).

## Configuration

Surface: `config.advanced.ai` (kv['config']). The faces-specific knobs
live under `advanced.ai.faces.*`; every value can also be overridden at
deploy time via a `TGDL_FACES_<KEY>` env var (deployment > config >
default).

Old flat keys (`facesServiceUrl`, `facesEpsilon`, `facesMinPoints`,
`facesDetector`, `facesLabelMatchEps`, `federateFaces`) are migrated
into `advanced.ai.faces.*` on first load and kept as read-only aliases.
Existing operator configs continue to work without changes; new code
should read the nested path.

Env-var precedence is strict: any `TGDL_FACES_*` value wins over the
matching kv-config value, which wins over the legacy flat alias, which
wins over the hardcoded default. Do **not** inject UI-tunable knobs
(`videoScanLimit`, `videoNice`, …) with compose `:-0` defaults — that
pins unlimited/off and silently ignores Maintenance settings. Leave
unset unless you intend a deploy-time override. Number arrays accept
`,` or `:` as separators (`5000,5999` or `5000:5999` both work).

## How it works

### Face pass

1. **Phase A** — for every photo whose `downloads.ai_indexed_at IS NULL`,
   POST to the sidecar's `/detect`. Persist bounding box + 512-dim
   embedding + landmarks to the `faces` table. Stamp `ai_indexed_at`
   regardless of detected face count, so a re-scan doesn't re-decode
   photos that yielded zero faces.

2. **Phase B (incremental, default)** — only faces with
   `person_id IS NULL` are considered. Faces within `epsilon` of any
   excluded centroid stay unassigned (no attach, no leftover DBSCAN).
   Remaining faces attach to the nearest existing person within
   `epsilon`, otherwise leftovers are DBSCAN'd into **new** people.
   Existing people, merges, splits, labels, and covers are left alone.
   End-of-scan Phase B and **Re-cluster** use this path.

3. **Rebuild all clusters (destructive)** — the old wipe+DBSCAN path:
   `clearAllPeople()`, DBSCAN over every face, recreate people. Labels /
   covers / exclusions carry over via centroid match. Use after changing
   `epsilon` when a global reshuffle is wanted. **Merges are not
   preserved.** Exposed as **Rebuild all clusters** in the UI /
   `POST /api/ai/faces/rebuild`.

### Cluster operations

The maintenance page surfaces:

- **Rename** — set a label on a cluster. Survives both Re-cluster and
  Rebuild (via centroid match on Rebuild).
- **Merge** — fold one cluster into another. Survives **Re-cluster**
  (incremental). Lost on **Rebuild all** / Reindex. Target centroid is
  recomputed from all faces after merge.
- **Split** — pick faces from a cluster, create a new cluster, link
  those faces to it. The original keeps the rest.
- **Reassign** — move one face between clusters.
- **Exclude** — durable denylist so an identity does not reappear.

### Auto-pregeneration on new downloads

The downloader's `pregenerateAi(downloadId)` hook fires after each
successful download. When `cfg.faceClustering === true` it runs face
detection on the new row and writes the embeddings into `faces`. The
clustering pass is a batch operation — kick it off explicitly from the
maintenance page when you want it.

### Video face scanning

When `advanced.ai.faces.scanVideos` is `true`, the scan runner includes
`file_type = 'video'` rows in the phase A total alongside photos.
Videos are processed one at a time after the photo batch finishes.

**Sampling is duration-independent** — the same fixed cadence applies to
a 10-second clip and a 4-hour recording; there are no duration bands and
no per-video sampling budget. The sidecar's `POST /detect/video` endpoint
walks the video with a single sequential `cv2.VideoCapture` decode (no
seeking — `cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES` seeking is unreliable on long-GOP
H.264/HEVC) and streams sampled frames through detection one at a time,
so memory stays bounded regardless of video length:

- Every `videoWindowSec` (default 0.4s) the sharpest frame in that window
  becomes a candidate. It's *kept* once it differs enough from the last
  kept sample (motion) or `videoFloorIntervalSec` (default 3.0s) has
  elapsed with no motion at all (a static-scene backstop).
- `videoMaxFrames` (default 20000) is a pure runaway-safety ceiling, not
  a density knob — it should essentially never bind for a real video.
- Detections across frames are merged into per-identity **tracks**: a
  track confirmed by ≥2 sampled frames is kept only if it also clears a
  quality floor (catches the detector consistently misfiring on the same
  non-face texture, which repetition alone wouldn't catch); a track seen
  in only 1 frame needs a stricter score+quality bar. Confirmed tracks
  keep up to 3 pose-diverse representative faces instead of collapsing
  to a single embedding.

This is a deliberate accuracy-over-speed trade: a 2-hour video can
legitimately take thousands of detection calls instead of the old ~120.

#### Video b64 fallback (external sidecar)

When the sidecar runs externally without shared filesystem access, the
`/detect/video` path mode returns 403. The Node client automatically
falls back to a local ffmpeg-based pipeline that mirrors the sidecar's
approach:

1. One continuous ffmpeg process (no per-frame spawn, no `-ss` seeking)
   using a single `select` filter that combines the duration-independent
   floor with ffmpeg's own scene-change score as the motion trigger.
2. Frames are parsed off ffmpeg's `stdout` incrementally and dispatched
   to `POST /detect/batch-b64` in small windows (8 frames), discarding
   each window's raw bytes right after — memory doesn't scale with video
   length here either. Falls back to sequential `/detect` calls if
   `batch-b64` isn't available (older sidecar).
3. The same track-confirmation + best-N dedup logic as the sidecar path
   (ported to JS, kept behaviorally in sync) runs over the results.

The fallback activates transparently — no configuration needed. Once
`_pathRejectedLogged` is set (by any 403 from photos or video), all
subsequent video calls skip the path-mode attempt entirely.

The Node fallback's `select` filter has no equivalent to `videoWindowSec`
(no windowing concept) and uses ffmpeg's own differently-scaled `scene`
score instead of `videoMotionThreshold`'s 0–255 luma-diff — those two
knobs are sidecar-only (see the table above). `videoFloorIntervalSec` and
`videoMaxFrames` apply to both paths.

Embeddings from video frames land in the same `faces` table and use the
same 512-dim ArcFace space as photo-sourced faces. Phase B DBSCAN
clusters them together — the same person in a photo and a video ends up
in the same People group automatically.

Off by default; toggle via the AI maintenance page or set
`advanced.ai.faces.scanVideos = true` in the config.

#### Video scan progress reporting

`POST /detect/video` is a single blocking request that can legitimately
take many minutes on a long or dense video — without this, the
maintenance dashboard's progress bar looks frozen for the entire
duration of that one video (it only advances once per video, not once
per frame). To fix that:

1. When `detectFacesInVideo` is called with an `onVideoProgress`
   callback (scan-runner.js always supplies one), the Node client
   generates a `job_id` and includes it in the `POST /detect/video`
   body.
2. The sidecar reports its decode position into an in-memory registry
   (`tgdl_faces/video_progress.py`) as `extract_video_frames` walks the
   video — one report per decoded frame, keyed by `job_id`. The registry
   entry is removed once the request finishes (success, soft-error, or
   exception), via a `try`/`finally` around the whole detect body.
3. While the main request is in flight, the Node client polls
   `GET /detect/video/status/{job_id}` every `videoProgressPollMs`
   (default 5000 ms) and forwards the parsed `{frames_decoded,
   total_frames, pct, elapsed_sec}` payload to `onVideoProgress`.
4. `scan-runner.js` stores this on `state.currentVideo` (cleared back to
   `null` once that video finishes) and broadcasts it with the rest of
   the scan progress; the maintenance page renders it as e.g.
   `Video: clip.mp4 — 42% decoded (3,412/8,120 frames)` in place of the
   generic "Scanning…" text.

The reported percentage is decode position (`frames_decoded /
total_frames`), not a "faces found so far" count — the streaming
pipeline's bounded sliding window means decode and detection run in
near-lockstep, so decode-% is an accurate proxy for "how far through the
video are we" without needing a second counter. Polling is best-effort
telemetry: a poll failure, a `404` (job already finished, or the sidecar
predates `job_id` support), or omitting `onVideoProgress` entirely never
affects the returned faces — it just means no mid-flight progress is
shown. Not wired for the Node b64 fallback path (`_detectVideoB64Fallback`)
since it doesn't currently know `total_frames` up front.

### CPU throttle

The `cpuThrottleRatio` knob controls a duty-cycle rest inserted after
each detection call. The scanner sleeps for `ratio * elapsedMs` after
every sidecar round-trip, giving the CPU proportional breathing room
between work bursts. The sleep is dynamic — slow hardware (longer
elapsed time) gets longer rests; fast GPU inference barely notices it.
Single-call rest is capped at 5 000 ms so a stalled video frame cannot
freeze the entire loop.

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `0` | No throttle — full speed. Recommended for GPU users. |
| `0.5` (default) | Rest for half the detection time. |
| `1.0` | Rest equal to detection time (50 % duty cycle). |
| `2.0` | Sleep 2x the detection time. Keeps CPU cool on Pi / NAS. |

Range is clamped to `[0, 5]`. Set via `advanced.ai.faces.cpuThrottleRatio`
in config or `TGDL_FACES_CPU_THROTTLE_RATIO` env var.

### Video CPU priority (nice)

`videoNice` lowers OS scheduling priority **during the video phase only**
(photos keep normal priority). On Linux it applies at three layers:

1. **Node scan loop** — `process.setPriority()` for the duration of Phase A videos
2. **ffmpeg fallback** — spawns `nice -n <N> ffmpeg …` when path-mode is unavailable
3. **Sidecar** — `os.nice()` for the lifetime of each `POST /detect/video` request
   (Node forwards `nice` in the JSON body; that beats `TGDL_FACES_VIDEO_NICE`)

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `0` (default) | Normal priority |
| `10` | Background-friendly — good starting point for testing |
| `15`–`19` | Very low priority — use when the host is shared / CPU-constrained |

Unix only; ignored on Windows. Set via Maintenance → AI → **Video CPU
priority (nice)** or config `advanced.ai.faces.videoNice`. Optional
deploy-time pin: `TGDL_FACES_VIDEO_NICE` on **both** services — but do
**not** inject compose `:-0`/`:-10` defaults or the UI value is ignored
(env beats kv on Node; request body beats env on the sidecar).

For Docker-level weighting independent of nice, you can also lower
`cpu_shares` on the `tgdl-faces` service (see `docker-compose.yml` comment).

### Detector model options

The `detectorModel` config key selects the insightface model pack loaded
by the sidecar. All presets produce 512-dim L2-normalised ArcFace
embeddings and are clustering-compatible with each other — switching
models does not require a re-scan of already-indexed photos, but a
re-cluster is triggered automatically on the next scan because the
embedding distributions differ slightly across backbones.

| Preset | Backbone | LFW accuracy | Relative CPU speed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `buffalo_l` | ResNet50 | 99.5 % | 1.0x (baseline) | Default. Best balance of speed and accuracy. |
| `antelopev2` | ResNet100 + Glint360K | 99.6 % | ~2.3x slower | Best accuracy. Worth it on GPU; heavy on CPU. |
| `buffalo_m` | ResNet50 (smaller) | 99.3 % | faster | Lighter than `buffalo_l`. |
| `buffalo_s` | ResNet34 | 99.0 % | fastest | Minimal resource footprint. |

Set via `advanced.ai.faces.detectorModel` or
`TGDL_FACES_DETECTOR_MODEL` env var. The AI maintenance page also
exposes a dropdown. Changing the model restarts the sidecar
automatically.

### Model preload

Switching `detectorModel` to a preset that has not been downloaded yet
causes a potentially long delay on the first sidecar boot while
insightface fetches the model pack. The preload endpoints let you
trigger the download in advance without changing the active model:

| Method | Sidecar path | Node proxy | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/preload/{model}` | `/api/ai/preload-model/:name` | Start background download |
| `GET` | `/preload/{model}/status` | `/api/ai/preload-model/:name/status` | Check download status |

Status values: `downloading`, `ready`, `invalid`, `failed`. The
download runs in a background thread; the sidecar continues serving
detection requests on the current model while the new one downloads.

### Orphan cleanup

A SQLite trigger (`trg_purge_orphan_people`) automatically deletes a
`people` row when all its linked `faces` rows have been cascade-deleted.
This fires on `DELETE FROM faces` when the deleted row's `person_id` is
not null and no other faces reference the same person. The effect is
that deleting a download (which cascade-deletes its faces) transparently
prunes empty people entries — no manual cleanup needed.

## Offline install

For air-gapped / corporate-proxy environments:

1. Download the matching tarball from the
   [GitHub release page](https://github.com/botnick/telegram-media-downloader/releases)
   on a machine that has internet access. The asset names match
   `tgdl-faces-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz`.

2. Extract the binary onto the offline host at:
   ```
   data/faces-service/bin/tgdl-faces-<platform>-<arch>[.exe]
   ```
   On Linux/macOS make it executable: `chmod +x …`.

3. Tell the spawn module not to attempt a download:
   ```bash
   export TGDL_FACES_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=false
   npm start
   ```

   Or, equivalent, pin the URL to a corporate mirror:
   ```bash
   export TGDL_FACES_SIDECAR_BIN_URL=https://mirror.corp/tgdl-faces.tar.gz
   ```

Alternatively use the `downloadMirrors` config knob to list alternative
URLs the spawn module should try before falling back to GitHub:

```json
{
  "advanced": {
    "ai": {
      "faces": {
        "downloadMirrors": [
          "https://mirror.corp/sidecars",
          "https://backup.example/tgdl-faces.tar.gz"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

URLs ending in `.tar.gz` are taken verbatim; bare base URLs have
`/<slug>.tar.gz` appended.

## GPU acceleration

The sidecar reads `TGDL_FACES_PROVIDERS` and forwards the resolved
chain to onnxruntime. Options:

- **`auto`** (default) — picks the fastest available provider on the
  current platform. On Windows: CUDA → CPU (DirectML is excluded from
  auto because it crashes with uvicorn's asyncio threadpool). On Linux:
  CUDA → OpenVINO → CPU. On macOS: CoreML → CPU.
- **`cuda`** — NVIDIA GPU. Requires `onnxruntime-gpu` wheel + CUDA
  Toolkit 12.x + cuDNN 9 installed on the host (see below).
- **`coreml`** — Apple Silicon Neural Engine. Works on macOS arm64 with
  the standard release out of the box.
- **`directml`** — Windows GPU compute via DirectML. Requires the
  `onnxruntime-directml` wheel. **Note:** has known threading issues with
  uvicorn asyncio worker threads on Windows (STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION crash)
  — use CUDA instead if you have an NVIDIA GPU.
- **`cpu`** — force CPU even when a GPU provider is available.

Boot logs print the resolved provider chain:
```
[tgdl-faces] INFO loading buffalo_l from ... (providers=['CUDAExecutionProvider','CPUExecutionProvider'] requested=auto det_size=(480, 480))
```

`/health` and `/info` both surface `providers_resolved` so the AI
maintenance card shows the actually-active provider. If a GPU provider
was requested but onnxruntime fell back to CPU (missing DLLs, etc.) the
sidecar logs a warning and the health endpoint correctly reports CPU.

### NVIDIA CUDA setup (Windows / Linux)

The Python sidecar (`faces-service/`) can run on CUDA when:

1. **`onnxruntime-gpu` is installed** (replaces the default CPU wheel):
   ```bash
   # from the repo root — uninstalls onnxruntime / onnxruntime-directml first
   pip install -e faces-service/[gpu]
   # or: python -m tgdl_faces.install --force gpu
   ```

2. **CUDA Toolkit 12.x** is installed on the host:
   - Download: <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>
   - Choose CUDA 12.6 (latest 12.x). Runtime installer (~300 MB) is enough
     — you do not need the full development toolkit.
   - On Windows: run the `.exe` installer, reboot if prompted.
   - On Linux: follow the distro-specific instructions on the download page.

3. **cuDNN 9** is installed:
   - Download via NVIDIA Developer: <https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn>
   - On Windows: copy the DLLs from the cuDNN archive into
     `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.x\bin\`.
   - On Linux: install the `libcudnn9-cuda-12` package from the NVIDIA
     repo (same page provides apt/yum commands).

After installing, restart the sidecar. Boot log should show:
```
Applied providers: ['CUDAExecutionProvider'], with options: ...
[tgdl-faces] INFO buffalo_l ready (..., gpu_provider=cuda)
```

If the sidecar still falls back to CPU it will log a warning:
```
WARNING GPU provider was requested ... but onnxruntime fell back to CPUExecutionProvider
        — likely missing runtime libraries.
```
Check that `cublasLt64_12.dll` (Windows) / `libcublasLt.so.12` (Linux)
is in the system library path.

#### TensorRT EP (optional — CUDA EP already gives full GPU speed)

When `onnxruntime-gpu` is installed it also ships a TensorRT execution
provider (`onnxruntime_providers_tensorrt.dll` / `.so`). At startup
onnxruntime probes every available EP; if TensorRT's runtime DLLs are
missing you will see a harmless warning in the log:

```
EP Error ... onnxruntime_providers_tensorrt.dll ... "nvinfer_10.dll" ... missing (Error 126)
```

**This is not a failure.** onnxruntime skips TensorRT EP and uses CUDA EP
instead — inference speed is unaffected for the face models used here.
You can safely ignore the warning.

If you *do* want TensorRT EP (marginal gain for buffalo_l, larger gain for
higher-res models):

1. Download **TensorRT 10.x** from <https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt>
   (requires a free NVIDIA developer account).
2. Extract the archive and add its `lib\` folder to the system `PATH`:
   - Windows: `setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\path\to\TensorRT-10.x.x.x\lib"`
     — or copy `nvinfer_10.dll`, `nvinfer_builder_resource_10.dll`,
     `nvonnxparser_10.dll` into the CUDA Toolkit `bin\` folder
     (`C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.x\bin\`).
   - Linux: add the lib path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or run
     `ldconfig` after copying the `.so` files to `/usr/local/lib`.
3. Install the Python TensorRT wheel (must match TRT version):
   ```bash
   pip install tensorrt==10.*
   ```
4. Restart the sidecar. Set `providers=tensorrt` (or leave on `auto` —
   onnxruntime will pick TRT first automatically now that the DLLs are
   present). Boot log should show:
   ```
   Applied providers: ['TensorrtExecutionProvider', 'CUDAExecutionProvider']
   ```

The prebuilt binary (`tgdl-faces-*.exe`) ships the CPU onnxruntime and
cannot switch to CUDA or TensorRT. GPU acceleration requires either the
Python fallback path (`pip install -e faces-service/[gpu]`) or a custom
Docker image built with `Dockerfile.cuda`.

## API surface

All endpoints are admin-only.

| Method | Path                                | Notes                                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

| POST   | `/api/ai/scan/start`                | `{ feature: 'faces' }` — Phase A + incremental Phase B |
| POST   | `/api/ai/scan/cancel`               | same body shape                                        |
| GET    | `/api/ai/scan/status?feature=faces` | live state for re-mounted page                         |
| POST   | `/api/ai/faces/recluster`           | incremental Phase B only (skip detection; keeps merges) |
| POST   | `/api/ai/faces/rebuild`             | full wipe+DBSCAN reshape (merges lost)                 |
| GET    | `/api/ai/people`                    | clusters with cover face + count                       |
| GET    | `/api/ai/people/excluded`           | durable exclusion denylist (`{ excluded, total }`)     |
| GET    | `/api/ai/people/:id/photos`         | paginated photos in this cluster                       |
| PATCH  | `/api/ai/people/:id`                | `{ label }` — rename                                   |
| POST   | `/api/ai/people/:id/cover`          | `{ faceId }` — pin People avatar thumbnail             |
| DELETE | `/api/ai/people/:id`                | temporary drop (faces unassigned; may reappear)        |
| POST   | `/api/ai/people/:id/exclude`        | durable exclude — skipped by Phase B recluster         |
| DELETE | `/api/ai/people/excluded/:id`       | un-exclude (next recluster may recreate)               |
| POST   | `/api/ai/people/:id/merge`          | `{ otherId }` — fold one cluster into another          |
| POST   | `/api/ai/people/:id/split`          | `{ faceIds, newLabel? }` — create a new cluster        |
| POST   | `/api/ai/faces/:id/reassign`        | `{ personId }` — move a single face to another cluster |
| GET    | `/api/ai/faces/by-download/:id`     | face boxes for the gallery viewer overlay              |
| POST   | `/api/ai/preload-model/:name`       | trigger background model download (proxy to sidecar)   |
| GET    | `/api/ai/preload-model/:name/status`| check model download status                            |

**Delete vs Exclude.** `DELETE /api/ai/people/:id` only drops the
cluster row (faces become unassigned); the next **incremental** Phase B
may recreate a cluster from those faces. `POST /api/ai/people/:id/exclude`
snapshots the centroid into `excluded_people` so faces within `epsilon`
of that centroid stay unassigned (neither attached to an existing person
nor formed into a new Person — including after split→exclude). Full faces
reindex clears the denylist (embedding space may change with the detector
model).

**Re-cluster vs Rebuild.** Re-cluster assigns only unassigned faces and
preserves merges. Rebuild all clusters wipes People and re-DBSCANs
everything (use after changing ε).

## Sidecar wire format

| Method | Path | Body | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | — | `{ ok, version, model, dim, ready, providers_resolved, providers_requested, det_size, platform, python }` (always HTTP 200) |
| `GET` | `/info` | — | `{ model, dim, providers, providers_requested, det_size, platform, python, version }` |
| `POST` | `/detect` | `{ path \| image_b64, min_score?, min_box_px?, ar_range? }` | `{ faces[], image_w, image_h }` |
| `POST` | `/detect-embed` | _alias of `/detect`_ | — |
| `POST` | `/detect/batch` | `{ files[] }` | `{ results: [{ file, faces[], image_w, image_h }] }` |
| `POST` | `/detect/batch-b64` | `{ images: [b64…], min_score?, min_box_px?, ar_range? }` | `{ results: [{ faces[], error? }], total_images, total_faces }` — GPU-pipelined parallel detect |
| `POST` | `/detect/video` | `{ path, max_frames? }` | `{ faces[], image_w, image_h }` (deduplicated across frames) |
| `POST` | `/preload/{model}` | — | `{ model, status }` — trigger background model download |
| `GET`  | `/preload/{model}/status` | — | `{ model, status }` — `downloading` / `ready` / `invalid` / `failed` |

Path mode requires the path to resolve inside `TGDL_FACES_ALLOW_ROOTS`
(set by the spawn module to `data/downloads`). Base64 mode works without
an allow-root and is used automatically when path mode 403s.

## Related subsystem knobs

### Thumbs auto-generate toggle

`advanced.thumbs.autoOnDownload` (default `true`) controls whether a
WebP thumbnail is generated immediately after each successful download.
When `true`, the downloader calls `pregenerateThumb(id)` inline so the
first gallery scroll already finds the thumbnail in cache. Set to
`false` to defer generation to the on-demand path (the viewer creates
the thumb lazily on first request). The toggle has no effect on
bulk-regeneration from the Maintenance page.

### GPU scaler probe

The thumbnail and seekbar generators share a runtime probe that tests
whether the active ffmpeg binary supports GPU-resident scaling filters.
On first use the probe runs `ffmpeg -filters` and checks for
`scale_cuda` (NVIDIA), `scale_vaapi` (Intel/AMD on Linux), and
`vpp_qsv` (Intel Quick Sync). The result is cached for the process
lifetime.

When a GPU scaler filter is present, the full pipeline keeps decoded
frames on the GPU through the scale step (`-hwaccel <backend>
-hwaccel_output_format <backend>` + `scale_cuda=w=…` or
`scale_vaapi=w=…`), downloading to CPU only for the final software
WebP/JPEG encode. When the filter is absent — common in minimal ffmpeg
builds (Alpine/musl, Windows static binaries) or decode-only backends
like `videotoolbox` / `d3d11va` — the pipeline falls back to software
`scale=…:flags=fast_bilinear` while still using GPU-accelerated decode
where available.

No configuration is needed; the probe is transparent. The seekbar
module uses a variant pipeline (`hwaccelUploadPipeline`) that uploads
CPU-decoded frames to the GPU for scaling, necessary because fps/tile
filters run in software between decode and scale.

## Troubleshooting

**Faces page shows "AI disabled"** — flip
`config.advanced.ai.enabled = true` and
`config.advanced.ai.faceClustering = true` in **Maintenance → AI** or
via `/api/config`.

**Sidecar binary download failed** — check the AI maintenance card for
the error code. Common causes:

- *Corporate proxy blocks GitHub release CDN*: set
  `TGDL_FACES_SIDECAR_BIN_URL` to your internal mirror, or list
  alternatives in `faces.downloadMirrors`.
- *Offline / air-gapped*: see the
  [Offline install](#offline-install) section.
- *AV quarantine*: the spawn module retries 3× on disk-level failures.
  Persistent failures surface as `binary verification failed`. Add the
  binary path to your AV exclusion list.

**Sidecar health probe failing** — the spawn module relaunches after
3 consecutive failed probes. If the relaunch loop persists, the
sidecar's own logs (visible via the dashboard's maintenance logs panel,
source `ai-faces-spawn`) usually pinpoint the cause. Common ones:

- *Port exhaustion*: bump `TGDL_FACES_PORT_RANGE` to a wider window.
- *Long model load on slow disks*: bump
  `TGDL_FACES_FIRST_BOOT_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS=120000`.
- *Memory pressure on Pi 4*: default `detSize` is already 480; drop to
  `TGDL_FACES_DET_SIZE=320` and set `TGDL_FACES_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2` to
  cap inflight detect calls further.

**Faces table grows but People grid stays empty** — phase B (clustering)
hasn't run, or every face is below `minPoints`. Confirm by checking
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM faces` vs `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM people`; if faces
exist but people don't, drop `minPoints` to 2 or click **Detect &
cluster** again to force phase B.

**`EP Error … nvinfer_10.dll … missing (Error 126)`** — the TensorRT
runtime DLLs are not installed. This is a **non-fatal warning**; inference
continues on CUDA EP or CPU EP. Install TensorRT 10.x only if you
specifically need TRT EP (see [TensorRT EP (optional)](#tensorrt-ep-optional--cuda-ep-already-gives-full-gpu-speed) above). To suppress the
warning entirely, pin the provider explicitly:
```
TGDL_FACES_PROVIDERS=cuda    # or: cpu
```
or via **Maintenance → AI → Inference provider** → select **CUDA** or **CPU**.

**`Statement::JS_all` OOM** — should never happen for the faces table;
the scan-runner flows through streamed iterators. If you see one, it's
a regression — `scripts/check-oom-patterns.sh` should have caught it.
File a bug with the stack trace.

## NSFW External Sidecar (v2.20.0+)

The NSFW classifier can be offloaded to a remote GPU server, mirroring the faces sidecar pattern. When no URL is set, the built-in WASM classifier runs in-process (CPU).

### Setup

```bash
cd nsfw-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py                        # default: 0.0.0.0:8012
TGDL_NSFW_PORT=9000 python main.py    # custom port
```

Or use the GPU Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.gpu -t nsfw-sidecar .
docker run --gpus all -p 8012:8012 nsfw-sidecar
```

### Configuration

| Config key | Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `advanced.nsfw.sidecarUrl` | `TGDL_NSFW_SIDECAR_URL` | `''` | External classifier URL; empty = local WASM |

Set via **Maintenance → NSFW → External classifier URL** in the dashboard, or via env var for Docker deployments.

### Endpoints (nsfw-service)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | `{ok, model, ready, version, device, uptime_sec}` |
| `POST` | `/classify` | `{path \| image_b64}` → `{score, label}` |
| `POST` | `/classify/batch` | `{files[]}` → `{results[]}` |

The Node client (`src/core/nsfw-client.js`) tries path mode first; if the sidecar returns 403 (can't see the file — common when running on a different machine), it falls back to sending the image as base64.
